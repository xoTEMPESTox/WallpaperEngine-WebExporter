## Description

Currently, the WallpaperEngine-WebExporter does not support audio in converted wallpapers. Many wallpapers in the Steam Workshop include audio components that are essential to the overall experience. Implementing audio support would significantly enhance the fidelity of converted wallpapers.

### Current Limitations
- No audio extraction from original wallpaper files
- No audio playback implementation in the web renderer
- No synchronization between audio and visual elements
- No audio format conversion for web compatibility
- No volume controls or audio settings

## Proposed Implementation

1. **Audio Extraction**
   - Implement audio file extraction from wallpaper packages
   - Support multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)
   - Extract audio metadata and timing information

2. **Web Audio Implementation**
   - Implement HTML5 Audio API or Web Audio API for playback
   - Create audio synchronization with visual elements
   - Add audio lifecycle management (play, pause, stop)
   - Implement proper audio resource cleanup

3. **Audio Format Conversion**
   - Add audio transcoding for web-compatible formats
   - Implement efficient compression while maintaining quality
   - Create fallback mechanisms for unsupported formats

4. **User Controls**
   - Add volume controls for wallpapers with audio
   - Implement mute/unmute functionality
   - Create global audio settings
   - Add audio visualization components

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implement audio streaming for large files
   - Add audio preloading strategies
   - Create memory management for audio resources
   - Implement audio context management for browser compatibility

## Implementation Approach

- Research audio formats used in Steam Workshop wallpapers
- Implement audio extraction in the conversion pipeline
- Create a web audio player component
- Add audio synchronization with existing animation timers
- Test with various wallpaper types that include audio
- Implement user controls and settings

## Additional Context

Audio is a crucial component of many high-quality wallpapers, especially those with reactive visuals that respond to music or sound. Implementing audio support would make the WebExporter a more complete solution for converting wallpapers, bringing it closer to feature parity with the original Wallpaper Engine application.

This feature would require careful consideration of browser autoplay policies and user experience, as unexpected audio can be disruptive. Proper controls and settings will be essential for a good user experience.
