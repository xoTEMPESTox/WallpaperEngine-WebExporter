## Description

The current shader implementation in the WallpaperEngine-WebExporter has several limitations that need to be addressed to improve compatibility with more complex wallpapers. The existing system needs enhancements to support a wider variety of shader types and provide better uniform handling mechanisms.

### Current Limitations
- Limited support for different shader types (only basic fragment/vertex shaders)
- Inefficient uniform handling that doesn't properly map to WebGL requirements
- Missing support for advanced shader features like multiple render targets
- No fallback mechanisms for unsupported shader operations

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Extended Shader Type Support**
   - Add support for geometry shaders
   - Implement compute shader capabilities
   - Better handling of shader model versions (SM40, SM50, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Uniform Handling**
   - Improve mapping of shader uniforms to WebGL uniform locations
   - Implement automatic uniform buffer management
   - Add support for structured buffers and texture arrays

3. **Robustness Improvements**
   - Add shader compilation error reporting and debugging tools
   - Implement graceful degradation for unsupported features
   - Create a validation system for shader compatibility

## Implementation Approach

- Refactor the existing shader parsing and compilation pipeline
- Implement a more comprehensive shader uniform management system
- Add support for additional WebGL extensions
- Create test cases for various shader types using existing converted wallpapers

## Additional Context

This improvement would significantly enhance the visual fidelity of converted wallpapers, especially those with complex visual effects. Many high-quality wallpapers in the Steam Workshop utilize advanced shader features that are currently not fully supported.
