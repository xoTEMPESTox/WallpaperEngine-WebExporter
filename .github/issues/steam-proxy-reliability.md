## Description

The Steam proxy service is a critical component for fetching wallpaper data from the Steam Workshop, but it currently lacks robustness features needed for reliable operation. To ensure consistent access to wallpapers, we need to improve the proxy's handling of rate limits, implement retry mechanisms, and add support for alternative CDN sources.

### Current Limitations
- No rate limiting handling which can lead to service interruptions
- Lack of retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Single point of failure with no alternative CDN sources
- No caching mechanism for frequently requested wallpapers
- Limited error reporting and monitoring capabilities

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Rate Limit Handling**
   - Implement rate limiting detection and backoff strategies
   - Add request queuing to manage burst traffic
   - Create rate limit monitoring and alerting

2. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Create retry policies based on error types

3. **Alternative CDN Sources**
   - Implement fallback mechanisms to alternative CDN sources
   - Add support for multiple proxy endpoints
   - Create a load balancing system for distributed requests

4. **Caching Layer**
   - Add caching for frequently requested wallpapers
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies
   - Create cache warming mechanisms for popular content

5. **Monitoring and Error Reporting**
   - Add detailed logging for proxy operations
   - Implement health checks for the proxy service
   - Create metrics collection for performance monitoring

## Implementation Approach

- Enhance the existing proxy API with resilience patterns
- Implement a caching layer using Redis or similar technology
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create monitoring dashboards for proxy performance
- Implement automated failover to alternative sources

## Additional Context

Reliability of the Steam proxy directly impacts the user experience of the WallpaperEngine-WebExporter. Users depend on consistent access to wallpapers, and any downtime or performance issues with the proxy can prevent them from using the application effectively.
