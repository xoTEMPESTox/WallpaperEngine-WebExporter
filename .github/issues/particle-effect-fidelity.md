## Description

The current particle system implementation lacks the fidelity and feature completeness of the original Wallpaper Engine. To provide a more authentic experience for converted wallpapers, we need to enhance our particle system with additional emitter types, physics simulation, and advanced rendering capabilities.

### Current Limitations
- Limited emitter types (only basic point emitters)
- Simplistic physics simulation with no collision detection
- Missing advanced particle behaviors like attractors, vortexes, or custom force fields
- No support for particle trails or advanced rendering techniques
- Lack of proper lifetime and interpolation controls

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Extended Emitter Types**
   - Implement line, box, sphere, and mesh-based emitters
   - Add support for animated emitters that change over time
   - Create burst emitters for timed particle releases

2. **Enhanced Physics Simulation**
   - Add collision detection with scene geometry
   - Implement gravity, wind, and custom force fields
   - Create particle-particle interaction systems
   - Add realistic physics materials for different particle types

3. **Advanced Rendering Features**
   - Implement particle trails and ribbon effects
   - Add support for animated textures on particles
   - Create blending modes for better visual effects
   - Add lighting interaction with particles

4. **Behavior Controls**
   - Add attractor and repulsor points
   - Implement vortex and turbulence fields
   - Create sub-emitters for particle chaining effects
   - Add noise-based movement for organic motion

## Implementation Approach

- Analyze existing particle systems in converted wallpapers to identify missing features
- Extend the current particle engine with modular components
- Implement a behavior system that allows combining different effects
- Create performance optimization strategies for complex particle systems

## Additional Context

Many high-quality wallpapers in the Steam Workshop rely heavily on advanced particle effects for visual impact. Improving our particle system fidelity will significantly enhance the quality of converted wallpapers and provide a more complete recreation of the original experience.
